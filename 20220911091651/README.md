# Effective Java Section 4 Item 18

## Favor composition over inheritance.

Inheritance is a powerful way to achieve code reuse, but it is not always the best tool for the job.Used inappropriately, it leads to fragile software.

**Unlike method invocation, inheritance violates encapsulation**[example](https://github.com/Reza-Rahmani1378/effective-java/blob/develop/effective-java/src/main/java/com/amazon/effective_java/section4/item18/InstrumentedHashSet.java)
