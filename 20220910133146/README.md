# Effective java Section 4 Item 16

## In public classes, use accessor methods, not public fields.

### Summary :
public classes should never expose mutable fields. It is less harmful, though still questionable, for public classes to expose immutable fields. It is, however, sometimes desirable for package-private or private nested classes to expose fields, whether mutable or immutable.
