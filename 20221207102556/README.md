# Summary Hello Spring Security

## Summary 

- Spring Boot provides some default configurations when you add Spring Secu-
rity to the dependencies of the application.

- You implement the basic components for authentication and authorization:
UserDetailsService, PasswordEncoder, and AuthenticationProvider.

-You can define users with the User class. A user should at least have a user-
name, a password, and an authority. Authorities are actions that you allow a
user to do in the context of the application.

- A simple implementation of a UserDetailsService that Spring Security pro-
vides is InMemoryUserDetailsManager. You can add users to such an instance
of UserDetailsService to manage the user in the applicationâ€™s memory.

- The NoOpPasswordEncoder is an implementation of the PasswordEncoder
contract that uses passwords in cleartext. This implementation is good for
learning examples and (maybe) proof of concepts, but not for production-
ready applications.

- You can use the AuthenticationProvider contract to implement custom
authentication logic in the application.

- There are multiple ways to write configurations, but in a single application, you
should choose and stick to one approach. This helps to make your code cleaner
and easier to understand.
