# Java Effective Section 1 item 6

## Avoid creating unnecessary objects


### Notes :
 
 * The lesson is clear:**prefer primitives to boxed primitives, and watch out for unintentional autoboxing**. This item should not be misconstrued to imply that object creation is expensive and should be avoided.


 * Conversely, avoiding object creation by maintaining your own object pool is a bad idea unless the objects in the pool are extremely heavyweight.
