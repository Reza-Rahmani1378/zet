# Composite in Java

 * **Composite** is a structural design pattern that allows composing objects into a tree-like structure and work with the it as if it was a singular object.

 * Composite became a pretty popular solution for the most problems that require building a tree structure. Compositeâ€™s great feature is the ability to run methods recursively over the whole tree structure and sum up the results.
