## Stream peek() Method in Java 

**In Java, Stream provides an powerful alternative to process data where here we will be discussing one of the very frequently used methods named peek() which being a consumer action basically returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, additionally performing the provided action on each element as elements are consumed from the resulting stream. This is an intermediate operation, as it creates a new stream that, when traversed contains the elements of the initial stream that match the given predicate.**
